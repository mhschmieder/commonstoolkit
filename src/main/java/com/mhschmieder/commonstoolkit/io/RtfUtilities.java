/**
 * {@code RtfUtilities} is a utilities class for handling the RTF format, and
 * especially for converting from RTF to HTML. Although it must make use of the
 * Swing toolkit to accomplish this, the functionality is still closely related
 * to the rest of this library's emphasis on AWT as the Swing invocations are
 * strictly to gain access to the necessary conversion methods and don't
 * require an actual Swing GUI for the application that uses these utilities.
 * <p>
 * This class and its methods should be reviewed to see if they are too
 * specific compared to what they actually do; perhaps the methods should add
 * parameters for the source and destination MIME types, and see what all works?

 * @version 1.0
