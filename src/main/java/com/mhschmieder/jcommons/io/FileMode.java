/**
 * Enumeration of common file modes when handling File Menu actions. The "other"
 * instance marks the mode as needing extension by downstream clients, as we
 * can't inherit enums so we must supplement with an app-specific enum or class.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The Table Data category is for CSV as it isn't as detailed or flexible
 *  as Spreadsheet Data and is likely to be used in a narrow scope vs. app-level.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Image Data generally refers to individual images vs. application window
 *  screenshots. These images are sometimes data from computational runs or from
 *  visualizations, but can also be visual elements of the app that are handled
 *  a la carte and are not part of the shared representation of GUI controls.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Raster Graphics and Vector Graphics are given separate instances for
 *  Import and Export primarily because PDF files can be used as either category.
 *  There is also some overlap with CAD, but such files may also contain details
 *  from modeling and manufacturing realms that require domain-specific parsing.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Rendered Graphics are generally curated from elements in the GUI and not
 *  generated by a raster or vector screenshot as in the other two graphics modes.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Revise these comments for better in-line documentation of each mode.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Flesh out the general File Menu and sub-menus to capture all enums.
