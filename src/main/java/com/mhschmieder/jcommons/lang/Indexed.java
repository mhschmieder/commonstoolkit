/**
 * An interface to use with enums for features in libraries that predate Java 1.5
 * and thus took other approaches to guaranteeing locally-unique lookup values
 * for sets of related constants. In many cases, the legacy implementations are
 * baked into application project file formats and require integer index mapping.
 * <p>
 * As the indices are meant to be assigned to a private field at construction time
 * of each enum constant, the mapper from enum to index is named as a direct field
 * accessor vs. "getIndex()", in line with enum methods such as "ordinal()".
 * <p>
 * To get an enum from an index, only a static method is possible, and though we
 * could overload "valueOf()", it is safer to explicitly call it "valueOfIndex()"
 * in case the Java language ever needs to add its own int-parameter overload.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to declare a static method in an interface unless its
 * generic type is also static, so the "valueOfIndex() method can have a complete
 * mapping implementation of all enum constants but must be called from an enum
 * instantiation. This is best done by defining a local variable of the enum type
 * and then calling "valueOfIndex" to potentially reassign from the default value.
 * <p>
 * This interface is templated with a Generic argument so that the associated enum
 * can pass this interface into common implementations of listener factories and
 * other such features where enums being final classes cause programming issues.
 * <p>
 * Although oriented towards the needs of mapping between legacy integer values
 * and modern enums, this interface can be applied to other Java objects as well.
 * 
 * @param <T> The object or enum type that implements this interface
