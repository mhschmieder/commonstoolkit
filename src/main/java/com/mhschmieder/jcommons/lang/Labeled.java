/**
 * An interface to use with enums and other objects that don't have dedicated
 * handlers for what to present in List Cells, Radio Buttons and other GUI 
 * controls, such as those found in the drop down List View of a Combo Box or in
 * their associated Text Field showing the current list selection.
 * <p>
 * Such labels also serve as useful values to save using the Java Preferences API,
 * for session recall of preferred list selections and grouped control selections.
 * <p>
 * As the labels are meant to be assigned to a private field at construction time
 * of each enum constant, the mapper from enum to label is named as a direct field
 * accessor vs. "getLabel()", in line with enum methods such as "ordinal()".
 * <p>
 * To get an enum from a label, only a static method is possible, and though we
 * could overload "valueOf()", it is safer to explicitly call it "valueOfLabel()"
 * in case the Java language ever needs to add its own String-parameter overload.
 * <p>
 * It is not possible to declare a static method in an interface unless its
 * generic type is also static, so the "valueOfLabel() method can have a complete
 * mapping implementation of all enum constants but must be called from an enum
 * instantiation. This is best done by defining a local variable of the enum type
 * and then calling "valueOfLabel" to potentially reassign from the default value.
 * <p>
 * This interface is templated with a Generic argument so that the associated enum
 * can pass this interface into common implementations of listener factories and
 * other such features where enums being final classes cause programming issues.
 * One such example is a gatherer of an enum's complete list of values as labels
 * to feed to a Combo Box, or to pass to a factory method that generates listeners.
 * <p>
 * This is published to the commons toolkit as it isn't GUI specific or dependent
 * on a specific toolkit, and otherwise could not be applied to data model enums.
 * <p>
 * Although oriented towards the needs of mapping between enums and labels, this
 * interface can be applied to other Java objects as well.
 * 
 * @param <T> The object or enum type that implements this interface
