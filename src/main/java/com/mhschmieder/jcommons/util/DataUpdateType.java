 * Enumeration of data update types, focusing on the two most basic types.
 * <p>
 * In earlier times, it was common for advanced computational applications to
 * offer Fast Mode and Accurate Mode. This began to fall away in favor of two
 * options that vary more in speed than in accuracy: a full update vs. partial.
 * <p>
 * The latter is called Dynamic Update because usually it is triggered by mouse
 * drag actions, which can be fast and furious, vs. GUI buttons for full updates.
 * <p>
 * Consumers of this API may have data subsets that apply to Dynamic Updates.
